# **Speaker Verification System**

A Python-based Speaker Verification System that identifies and verifies speakers using their unique voice features. This project uses advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning models to analyze and classify audio inputs.

---



## **Introduction**
Speaker Verification Systems analyze the unique characteristics of a speakerâ€™s voice to verify their identity. This project leverages audio signal processing and machine learning to authenticate speakers based on pre-registered voice data. Applications include security systems, personalized services, and hands-free device control.

## **Features**
- **Speaker Enrollment**: Register and store unique voice features for known speakers.
- **Speaker Verification**: Verify a speaker's identity by matching their voice with the stored data.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Support for live audio or recorded files.
- **MFCC Feature Extraction**: Extract voice features using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).
- **Model Training and Testing**: Train and test the verification model on audio datasets.
